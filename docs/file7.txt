1.	Q: What is exercise?
A: Exercise means physical activity – inclusive of anything that gets you moving, such as walking, dancing, mopping the floor or working in the garden. You can reap the many benefits of exercise without going to a gym, playing strenuous sports or using lavish equipment. Regular physical activity helps insulin work better and improves your blood circulation. It lowers your blood glucose (sugar), blood pressure and cholesterol levels, thereby reducing your risk for heart disease and stroke.

2.	Q: How do I start exercising?
A: To start an exercise routine that is safe and enjoyable, remember FITTA:
- Frequency: 3-7 days a week.
- Intensity: Light to moderate (you sweat and breathe deeply).
- Time: At least 30 minutes (can accumulate in 10-minutes bouts).
- Type: All types of exercise that you like within safety limits.
- Aim: Energy expenditure of 1,000-2,000kcal (roughly 5 hours of slow walk per week)

3.	Q: Why do I need to monitor my blood glucose levels even before and after exercise?
A: Everyone’s blood glucose response to exercise is different. Checking your blood glucose before and after exercise prevents low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia). Hypoglycaemia occurs when blood glucose falls below 4mmol/L (72mg/dL). Severe hypoglycaemia can cause loss of consciousness.

4.	Q: What are some things I should take note of when I am exercising?
A: Here are some tips for safe exercise:
- Avoid injecting insulin into exercising limbs.
- When exercising in the evenings, increase carbohydrate intake to minimize hypoglycaemia at night.
- Always carry food/drinks in case you experience hypoglycaemia during exercise.
- Avoid exercising alone and always carry an identification tag.
- Wear suitable and well-fitting shoes and socks for exercise.
- If you have any diabetic complications, consult your doctor before exercise and seek the advice of an exercise specialist before starting.

5.	Q: What kinds of carbohydrates should I consume before exercise?
A: Depending on the intensity and duration of your exercise, as well as your blood glucose level, the recommended dietary carbohydrate intake will vary. Note that 15g of carbohydrates is equivalent to 1 slice of bread. If your blood glucose rises above 14 mmol/L, please consult your doctor.
- High-intensity exercise, < 30 mins (e.g., resistance training): If blood glucose is between 6 and 10 mmol/L, no food is required beforehand.
- Light exercise (e.g., walking 30 minutes, easy pace aerobics 60 minutes): If blood glucose is less than 6 mmol/L, take 15g of carbohydrates.
- Moderate exercise, < 45 mins (e.g., swimming, jogging, sports): If blood glucose is less than 6 mmol/L, take 30-45g of carbohydrates. If between 6 and 10 mmol/L, take 15g of carbohydrates.
- Strenuous exercise, > 60 mins (e.g., triathlon, marathon, cycling): If blood glucose is less than 6 mmol/L, take 45g of carbohydrates. If between 6 and 10 mmol/L, take 30-45g of carbohydrates. If between 10 and 14 mmol/L, take 15-30g of carbohydrates.

8.	Q: What is meal planning?
A: Meal planning will give you a guide on the amount and types of food you can choose to eat at meals and snack times. A good meal plan should fit in with your eating schedule and habits. Depending on whether you need to lose or maintain your weight, your doctor and/or dietician can help you create some meal plans that suit you most. Being on oral diabetic medications and/or insulin, you have to take extra care to make sure that your food intake is balanced with exercise to better manage your blood glucose levels. When you make wise food choices, you will improve your overall health and can even prevent complications such as heart disease and hypertension.

9.	Q: What is the Food Guide Pyramid?
A: The Food Guide Pyramid divides food into 6 food groups and emphasizes eating a certain number of servings from each food group. The largest group – grains, beans, and starchy vegetables – is at the bottom. This means that you should eat more servings of grains, beans, and starchy vegetables than any of the other foods. The smallest group – fats, sweets, and alcohol – is at the top of the pyramid. This means that you should eat very few servings from these food groups.

10.	Q: What should I take note of when I am eating out?
A: Here are some tips for eating out:
- Keep portion sizes in check. Order starters as mains, share meals with partner.
- Make substitutions. Ask for low-fat options when they are available.
- Watch what you drink. Sodas, shakes, ice-cream, and soft drinks have hundreds of calories.
- Eat on time. Consistent mealtime helps to maintain steady blood sugar levels. If you cannot avoid eating later than usual, snack on a fruit or have 2 to 3 slices of high fibre crackers.
- Sweets count as carbohydrates in your meal plan. Compensate by reducing the amount of other carbohydrates in your meals.

11.	Q: What is heart disease?
A: Heart disease is the most common life-threatening disease linked to diabetes. Experts say diabetes doubles a person’s risk of developing heart disease. In heart disease, deposits of fat and cholesterol build up in the arteries that supply the heart with blood. If this build-up blocks blood from getting to the heart, a potentially fatal heart attack can occur. The risk factors include hypertension or high blood pressure, obesity, high amounts of fats and cholesterol in blood, and cigarette smoking. Eliminating these risk factors, along with treating diabetes, can reduce the risk of heart disease. Long-term, uncontrolled diabetes may also cause destructive changes in blood vessels throughout the body, including the brain. If blood glucose levels are high at the time of a stroke, brain damage is usually more severe than when glucose is well controlled.

12.	Q: What is kidney disease?
A: Diabetics are also more likely to develop kidney disease than other people, but proper diabetes treatment can reduce the risk. Diabetes can affect the nerves that control the bladder, making it difficult for a person to empty his or her bladder completely. Bacteria can form in the unemptied bladder and the tubes leading from it, leading to urinary tract infection. Kidney problems may cause water retention, or edema, eventually leading to swelling, often in the legs and hands. High blood pressure also can add to the risk of kidney disease. While people can live without one kidney, those without both must have special treatment, called dialysis.

13.	Q: Can diabetes lead to eye problems?
A: Diabetes can affect the eyes in several ways. Changing levels of glucose in blood can affect the balance of fluid in the lens of the eye, which works like a flexible camera lens to focus images. Diabetes also may affect the function of nerves that control eyesight, causing blurred vision.
Source: Bayer HealthCare Diabetes Care

14.	Q: What is diabetic retinopathy?
A: Diabetic retinopathy is a disease of the light sensing tissue at the back of the eye; damage to the tiny vessels that supply the retina with blood. High blood pressure and smoking can cause the condition to worsen. Treatment for diabetic retinopathy can help prevent loss of vision and can sometimes restore vision lost because of the disease. People who have had diabetes for 25 years are more likely to develop retinopathy.

15.	Q: What are cataracts?
A: Cataract refers to the clouding of the normally clear lens of the eye. Cataracts in patients with diabetes appear to form when high levels of blood sugar react with proteins in the eye to form by-products that accumulate in the lens. Early diagnosis and treatment of cataracts can reduce the severity of this disorder.

16.	Q: What is glaucoma?
A: Glaucoma refers to pressure within the eye damaging the optic nerve. Hindrance of the blood flow and impaired nutrition of neuronal tissue are thought to be the cause. Early diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma can reduce the severity of this disorder.
Source: Bayer HealthCare Diabetes Care

17.	Q: Can diabetes lead to legs and feet problems?
A: Legs and foot problems can arise in people with diabetes due to changes in blood vessels and nerves in these areas. Peripheral vascular disease is a condition in which blood vessels become narrowed by fatty deposits, reducing blood supply to the legs and feet. Diabetes can dull the sensitivity of nerves. Someone with this condition, called peripheral neuropathy, might not notice a sore spot caused by tight shoes or pressure from walking. If ignored, this sore can become infected, and because blood circulation is poor, the area may take longer to heal. This can lead to leg ulcers and infections. Problems with the feet and legs can become serious and require amputation (surgical removal of limbs) if not treated early.

18.	Q: Tell me what I need to know about hyperglycaemia.
A: Hyperglycaemia (or very high blood glucose levels) is an acute complication of diabetes that causes symptoms such as frequent urination and excessive thirst. These symptoms may go unnoticed, especially in someone who is elderly or in poor health. Left unattended, a person with high blood glucose or hyperglycaemia can lose fluids, become weak, confused, and even unconscious. Breathing will be shallow and the pulse rate fast. The person’s lips and tongue will be dry, his or her hands and feet feeling cool. A doctor should be called immediately!
Source: Bayer HealthCare Diabetes Care

19.	Q: How to prevent hyperglycaemia?
A: Test your blood glucose levels often. It is recommended for insulin dependent patients to test 3 to 4 times a day and for non-insulin dependent patients to test one time a day. Continue to take your prescribed diabetes medication or insulin. Drink plenty of water and eat your regular meal after taking medication. Lastly, have plenty of rest, and visit your doctor regularly.
Source: Bayer HealthCare Diabetes Care

20.	Q: Tell me what I need to know about hypoglycaemia.
A: The opposite of high blood glucose – very low blood glucose – or hypoglycaemia, is also dangerous. Hypoglycaemia can occur when someone hasn’t eaten enough to balance the effects of insulin or oral medicine. Prolonged, strenuous exercise in someone taking oral diabetes drugs or insulin also can cause hypoglycaemia, as can alcohol. Someone whose blood glucose has become too low may feel nervous, shaky, and weak. The person may sweat, feel hungry, and have a headache. Severe hypoglycaemia can cause loss of consciousness.
Source: Bayer HealthCare Diabetes Care

21.	Q: What do I if I am experiencing hypoglycaemia?
A: Follow the 15-15 rule to arrest hypoglycaemia:
- Take 15g carbohydrate (1/2 cup fruit juice, ½ can soft drink, 2-4 tsp sugar, honey or syrup, or 3 glucose tablets).
- Test blood glucose after 15 minutes.
- If blood glucose still below 4 mmol/L (72 mg/dL), take another 15g carbohydrate.
- Test blood glucose 15 minutes later again.
If a hypoglycaemic person is unconscious, he or she should be taken to a hospital emergency room right away. An identification bracelet or necklace that states that the wearer has diabetes will let friends know that these symptoms are warning of illness that requires urgent medical help.

22.	Q: What is self-monitoring?
A: Self-monitoring of blood glucose means using a home glucose meter to check and track your own blood sugar levels when you are not seeing the doctor or in between appointments. A blood glucose test tells you how much glucose is in your blood at any point in time. Being able to check your blood sugar levels on a day-to-day basis and regularly can greatly improve your diabetes control. Today, there are advanced meters that can help you measure your blood sugar levels quickly and easily.
Source: Bayer HealthCare Diabetes Care

23.	Q: How can blood glucose monitoring help me?
A: One of the best ways to be sure your diabetes is under control is to monitor your blood glucose yourself. Research shows that good control of blood glucose can lower your risk of eye disease, kidney disease and nerve damage due to diabetes. Monitoring your own blood glucose lets you learn how your body react to daily events. You can then be more aware of what happens to your blood glucose during times of stress, when you exercise or when you are ill.
Source: Bayer HealthCare Diabetes Care

24.	Q: How often should I test for sugar levels?
A: For type 1 diabetes that is insulin treated, it is recommended to self-monitor 3 to 4 times daily, and at 2am if needed. For type 2 diabetes that is insulin treated, it is recommended to self-monitor 2 to 3 times daily, on 2 to 3 days of a week. For type 2 diabetes that is non-insulin treated, you are recommended to self-monitor frequently enough to facilitate reaching of glucose targets.

25.	Q: Why is it important to set goals and keep records?
A: It is vital to discuss your fasting, postprandial and bedtime blood glucose goals with your healthcare team. Having goals will ensure better success in improving your diabetes management. One of the ways to monitor your progress is to keep a record of your blood glucose readings. Also, write down the date, time, and whether the self-test was done before or after meals. Other information about diet, exercise, medication, or how you are feeling is also useful. You can bring along this record to show your doctor during your appointments so that he or she will have a better idea of how well your medications are working and whether their doses need to be fine-tuned.

26.	Q: When should I test my blood glucose?
A: The recommended timings for blood glucose testing are as follows:
- Before breakfast
- 1 to 2 hours after breakfast
- Before lunch
- 1 to 2 hours after lunch
- Before dinner
- 1 to 2 hours after dinner
- Before bedtime

27.	Q: What is blood pressure?
A: Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of arteries, which are blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body.
Source: Health Promotion Board

28.	Q: How is blood pressure measured?
A: Blood pressure is measured using two numbers (e.g., 120/80). The first number of a blood pressure reading is known as the systolic BP and measures the pressure blood places on the arteries as the heart is actively pumping blood into the arteries and through the circulatory system of the entire body. The second number is known as the diastolic BP and measures the pressure of the blood against the arteries when the heart is at rest between beats. Normal blood pressure for adults is less than 130/80mmHg (millimetres of mercury, a measure of pressure).
Source: Health Promotion Board

29.	Q: How does blood pressure change?
A: Your blood pressure changes depending on what you are doing. It may go up when you are excited, stressed, or exercising. It usually goes down when you are relaxed or sleeping. If your blood pressure is higher than 130/80mmHg most of the time even when you are resting, it is a sign that you need to take action to get your blood pressure under control.
Source: Health Promotion Board

30.	Q: What causes my blood pressure to go up?
A: Like water in a hose, the amount of blood in your arteries and the speed at which the heart pumps it through your body determines how much pressure your blood places against your blood vessel walls. Your blood pressure goes up when:
- There is too much salt in your diet which leads to water retention and an increase in the volume of blood circulating in your body.
- Your blood vessels become harder and narrower due to fatty deposits and prolonged high blood pressure.
- Your heart has to consistently pump too hard and too fast because of excessive smoking or alcohol.
If your blood pressure reading goes over 130/80mmHg, it is important to follow your doctor’s advice to get your blood pressure under control.
Source: Health Promotion Board

31.	Q: Why is high blood pressure dangerous?
A: People with high blood pressure usually don’t feel anything at the beginning. You can have high blood pressure for years without experiencing any symptoms even as it gradually causes damage to your heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of your body. This is why high blood pressure is called “the silent killer”.
Source: Health Promotion Board

32.	Q: What are the risks of high blood pressure?
A: People with high blood pressure are at risk of:
- Coronary heart disease
- Heart failure
- Stroke
- Peripheral artery disease (narrowing of the blood vessels of the limbs)
- Kidney failure
You can reduce the risk of developing these conditions by following your doctor’s advice and changing your lifestyle.
Source: Health Promotion Board

33.	Q: What causes high blood pressure?
A: For more than 95% of people with high blood pressure, there is no clear cause although there are risk factors that make it more likely for someone to develop the condition. Your risk of high blood pressure tends to increase as you age and if you:
- Are a smoker
- Have a body mass index of 23kg/m^2 or higher
- Eat foods that are high in fat and salt
- Drink more than 1-2 alcoholic drinks per day
- Do not get enough physical activity
- Experience high levels of stress on a constant basis
- Have other health conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease, thyroid disease, sleep apnoea, or pregnancy
- Take certain medication, such as asthma medicine (corticosteroids), cold-relief products, birth control pills, or hormone replacement therapy
- Have close relatives with high blood pressure

34.	Q: How do I know if I have high blood pressure?
A: Understand your numbers. People with normal blood pressure have a systolic BP of less than 130 mmHg, and a diastolic BP of less than 80 mmHg. People with borderline blood pressure have a systolic BP between 130 and 139 mmHg, and a diastolic BP between 80 and 89 mmHg. People with high blood pressure have a systolic BP of 140 mmHg or greater, and a diastolic BP of 90 mmHg or greater.
Source: Health Promotion Board

35.	Q: I feel fine, so does that mean I don’t have high blood pressure?
A: Most people with high blood pressure do not have any symptoms and feel fine. It is possible that you could have high blood pressure for some time without knowing it. This is why it is important to have your blood pressure measured at regular check-ups; people over 40 years old should have their blood pressure checked at least once a year. If you are diagnosed with high blood pressure, it is important to follow your doctor’s advice especially if you have been prescribed blood pressure medication. In addition to medication, dietary and lifestyle modifications will help lower your blood pressure and keep it from becoming a more serious illness.

36.	Q: How do I control my blood pressure?
A: High blood pressure is both preventable and manageable. With changes to your lifestyle and by taking your medication as prescribed, you can avoid many serious complications of high blood pressure. Here are some tips for keeping your blood pressure at healthy levels:
- Cut back on cigarettes
- Know your limits when it comes to alcohol
- Maintain a healthy weight
- Reduce the amount of salt and fat in your diet
- Get active
- Manage stress
- Go for regular check-ups
- Take blood pressure medication as prescribed

37.	Q: Why must I quit smoking to control my blood pressure?
A: The chemicals in cigarettes directly increase your risk of high blood pressure and also cause hardening of your arteries (atherosclerosis). Your doctor or pharmacist can help you find effective ways to quit smoking. It is never too late.
Source: Health Promotion Board

38.	Q: Why is alcohol bad for my blood pressure?
A: Alcohol not only increases your blood pressure, it is also high in calories which contribute to weight gain, another risk factor for high blood pressure. Women should drink no more than 2 standard drinks a day and mean should limit themselves to 3 standard drinks a day. A standard drink contains 10 grams of alcohol and is equivalent to two-thirds of a can (220ml) of regular beer, 1 glass (100ml) of wine, or 1 nip (30ml) of spirit.

44.	Q: How do I monitor my blood sugar levels?
A: Your health care provider will advise you on how often to check your blood sugar level to make sure you remain within your target range. You may, for example, need to check it once a day and before or after exercise. If you take insulin, you may need to do this multiple times a day. Monitoring is usually done with a small, at-home device called a blood glucose meter, which measures the amount of sugar in a drop of your blood. You should keep a record of your measurements to share with your health care team. Continuous glucose monitoring is an electronic system that records glucose levels every few minutes from a sensor placed under your skin. Information can be transmitted to a mobile device such as your phone, and the system can send alerts when levels are too high or too low.

45.	Q: How can I reduce my calorie intake, especially from carbohydrate?
A: Several studies in England have looked at the effects of a very low-calorie diet on diabetes. Two studies had people follow a mostly liquid diet of 625-850 calories a day for 2-5 months, followed by a less restricted diet designed to help them keep off the weight they lost. Both studies found that nearly half the people who took part reversed their diabetes and kept their blood glucose near the normal range for at least 6 months to a year. Currently, the American Diabetes Association recommends a low-carbohydrate eating pattern but doesn’t recommend a standard for grams. Nevertheless, a low-carb diet suggests eating the same amount of carbohydrates at every meal – around 45-60 grams – for a total of about 200 grams per day.  It is essential that you work with a professional and being very controlled with how many calories you eat. Ketogenic diets are supported by some doctors and scientists as a way to lose weight and stabilize blood sugar levels. Carbohydrates are heavily restricted in this diet, usually to less than 50 grams per day. In the absence of carbohydrates, the body must burn fat for energy, which results in rapid weight loss and positive effects on triglycerides and blood glucose levels. There are, however, some negative effects of this diet, including:
- Cramps in the muscles
- Breath that stinks
- Bowel habits change
- Energy loss
- An increase in cholesterol levels
Additionally, recent studies suggest that ketogenic diets increase hepatic insulin resistance and may deplete the body of some micronutrients. In order to determine whether this diet is safe and effective for long-term use, more research is needed.

46.	Q: What kinds of aerobic exercises are there?
A: Aerobic exercises can be walking, swimming, biking or running. Adults should aim for 30 minutes or more of moderate aerobic exercise on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes a week. Children should have 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise daily.

47.	Q: What are resistance exercises?
A: Resistance exercise increases your strength, balance and ability to perform activities of daily living more easily. Resistance training includes weightlifting, yoga and calisthenics. Adults living with type 2 diabetes should aim for two to three sessions of resistance exercise each week. Children should engage in activities that build strength and flexibility at least three days a week. This can include resistance exercises, sports and climbing on playground equipment.

48.	Q: What can I do if it is difficult for me to exercise?
A: Breaking up long bouts of inactivity, such as sitting at the computer, can help control blood sugar levels. Take a few minutes to stand, walk around or do some light activity every 30 minutes.
Source: Diabetes Singapore (https://www.diabetes.org.sg/about-diabetes/treatment/)

49.	Q: As long as I exercise, is it okay for me to eat what I want?
A: More physical activity is a way to improve diabetes, but it may be tough to lose enough weight to go into remission with workouts alone. When combined with changes to your eating, though, exercise helps. A modest, lower-calorie diet plus a big step-up in burning calories could put you on the path to remission. A study that had people aim for 10,000 steps a day and at least 2 1/2 hours of moderate exercise a week — along with cutting 500-750 calories a day and following a specific insulin and medication routine — saw more than half of them reach near-normal blood sugar without medication. Some were able to keep those levels long-term, too. The bottom line: It’s the weight loss that really matters. Exercise can help you get there, but expect to change your diet as well. During exercise, your cells become more sensitive to insulin and are better able to use glucose from your blood for energy. The contraction of your muscles also triggers your cells to absorb glucose without insulin. Regular physical activity can lower blood glucose levels and improve your HbA1C. By lowering your HbA1C, you may be able to take fewer diabetes pills or need less insulin.

50.	Q: What are some things I should take note of when I am exercising?
A: When you are exercising, take it slow. You can start small with a short walk if you aren’t used to exercising. Increase the duration and intensity gradually. You should also try to walk quickly. Exercise can be achieved by fast walking. A brisk walk is easy to do and does not require any equipment. Before, during, and after your workout, check your blood sugar. While exercising, keep a snack on hand in case your blood sugar drops.
