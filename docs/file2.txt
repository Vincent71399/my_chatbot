3.	Q: What is prediabetes?
A: Before people develop type 2 diabetes, almost all pass through the prediabetes stage where blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be considered as frank or overt diabetes. Importantly, having prediabetes means you are likely to progress on to diabetes in the near future.
Fasting glucose of someone with prediabetes is between 6.1-6.9 mmol/L and 2-hour plasma glucose after oral glucose tolerance test is between 7.8-11.0 mmol/L. There are no clear symptoms of prediabetes and the only reliable method of diagnosis is through blood tests.

4.	Q: What can I do if I have prediabetes?
A: You can start with lifestyle changes with modest weight loss of about 5 to 10% of body weight; and doing moderate-intensity physical activity. For example, you can consider going for brisk walking and participating in strength training. Also, remember to eat healthily and sensibly, avoid fad diets, and get adequate sleep and rest.

9.	Q: What can I eat if I have diabetes?
A: People with diabetes do not need to go on a special diet. Rather than a restrictive diet, a diet suitable for diabetes is simply a healthy eating plan that is individualized according to your requirements and lifestyle. You can see a dietician to guide you on dietary changes that can help you control your blood glucose levels and manage your weight. Also, it is important for you to understand how different foods affect your blood glucose levels, especially carbohydrates, since it is the nutrient that has the greatest effect on your blood glucose levels.

10.	Q: Do I need to follow a low carb diet?
A: People with diabetes do not need to go on a special diet. However, it is important that you understand how different foods affect your blood glucose levels, especially carbohydrates, since it the nutrient that has the greatest effect on your blood glucose levels. An important step to effective manage diabetes nutrition is to keep track of the amount of carbohydrates you consume by using carbohydrates counting techniques. When choosing the types of carbohydrates, pick starchy carbohydrate such as rice, noodles, pasta, cereals and starchy vegetables such as potatoes as these carbs release glucose into the blood stream at a slower rate compared to sugars, thus promoting a more stable blood glucose level.

15.	Q: How can diabetes affect my eyes? OR What is diabetic retinopathy?
A: Diabetic eye disease (diabetic retinopathy) results from reduced blood flow to the light-sensing nerve layer of the eye (retina). Over time, there is formation of fragile and leaky new blood vessels and nerve layer swelling. These changes can progress to blindness if not identified early or treated. There are two ways diabetes can affect your eyes: 1. Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy is the early stage of diabetic retinopathy and occure when the blood vessels become affected and start to leak and bleed. At this stage, vision is usually not affected. 2. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy occurs when there is growth of abnormal new blood vessels in the eye and these new vessels can rupture, causing significant bleeding that will lead to loss of vision.

16.	Q: What puts me at risk of diabetic retinopathy? OR What puts me at risk of diabetic eye disease?
A: All individuals with diabetes are at risk of developing diabetic retinopathy (diabetic eye disease). After 20 years of having diabetes, most people will develop this complication to some degree. However, those who have poorly controlled diabetes are at higher risk of developing diabetes retinopathy earlier and at more sever stages.

17.	Q: What can I do to protect my eyes if I have diabetes?
A: There are 3 ways that you can do to protect your eyes:
1. Keep your blood glucose levels in check.
2. Treating and keeping other medical conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and heart disease under control.
3. Quit smoking and exercising regularly.

30.	Q: Is Continuous Blood Glucose monitoring helpful for me?
A: There are benefits to using the Continuous Blood Glucose monitoring system. From the perspective of your healthcare team, it allows them to accurately detect asymptomatic or nocturnal hypoglycaemia and aids in adjustments of your medication and insulin doses, or even make nutritional adjustments. The system also contains alarms which can alert the user if the glucose level is rising or going below a pre-set threshold. IN addition, real-time continuous glucose monitoring may be combined with insulin pump therapy to allow for automated insulin suspension in response to a pre-set glucose level.

46.	Q: Why are wholegrains good for diabetes?
A: There is evidence to show that people who include wholegrains in their diet are less likely to get Type 2 diabetes. Though we don’t really know the exact reason why, it is believed that eating wholegrains can help control your blood glucose levels. The fibre in wholegrains take a longer time to digest, leading to a slower and lower spike in your blood glucose levels.

48.	Q: What can I do to prevent diabetes? OR What can be done to reduce the risk of diabetes?
A: Keeping your weight in check, maintaining an active lifestyle and eating a healthy diet can help prevent most cases of type 2 diabetes. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your body is to the action of insulin which helps in moving glucose from your bloodstream into the cells to be used as energy. The more active you are the easier it is to control your weight as glucose is used up as energy when you exercise and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. A balanced diet consist of less sugar/sugary foods, less fat/fatty foods and less salt/salty foods. Include more high fibre foods by switching to unpolished brown rice, whole grain cereals and breads. Remember to include fresh fruits and vegetables.
