One way to test for blood glucose levels using a glucometer, which is a small device that can be used at home or in healthcare settings. The test involves a finger-prick to indicate the blood glucose level at that moment, and it is convenient and relatively accurate when performed correctly. Even children can be taught to use a glucometer, making it essential for individuals with diabetes to monitor their levels. Another method is the HbA1c (haemoglobin A1c) test, which reflects average blood glucose control over a three-month period. The test measures glycated or sugar-coated haemoglobin A1c in red blood cells, which are typically replaced every three months. Although these tests are not universally accepted as diagnostic for diabetes mellitus, if a person shows symptoms of diabetes along with abnormal HbA1c and/or consistently high blood glucose levels on subsequent days, a doctor can confirm the diagnosis.

The Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) is used to confirm the presence of diabetes and can also differentiate individuals with impaired fasting or glucose tolerance. To prepare for the test, one must fast for at least eight hours before blood/plasma and urine samples are taken. The OGTT helps healthcare professionals assess how the body processes glucose and is an important diagnostic tool for diabetes.

Ketones are by-products of fat metabolism that result from the breakdown of fats. These substances are acidic in nature, and when excessive amounts accumulate in the body, they can have harmful effects, potentially poisoning brain cells. This situation arises when there is insufficient insulin to allow glucose to enter cells and provide them with fuel, or when there is an excess of stress hormones. If the level of ketones in the blood becomes too high, it can lead to a state of unconsciousness. This often occurs in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus, and the onset of this condition, known as Diabetic Keto-Acidosis (DKA), is usually sudden. DKA is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition.

Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) is a condition that precedes the development of diabetes. In individuals with IGT, blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not yet elevated enough to meet the criteria for a diabetes diagnosis. Under normal circumstances, there is a balance between insulin and glucose levels in the body. When blood glucose levels rise, the body responds by producing more insulin to lower the glucose level, a process known as a feedback mechanism. In the case of IGT, this feedback mechanism is not functioning optimally, leading to elevated blood sugar levels that are not yet in the diabetic range. It is essential to monitor and manage IGT to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes and its associated complications.

While your choice of beverage alone may not directly cause diabetes, genetics also play a significant role in predisposing a person to the condition. However, it is important to be aware that consuming a lot of fruit juices or fizzy drinks can have negative health effects. These beverages are typically high in sugar content and calories. When consumed in excess, they can contribute to obesity, which is a known risk factor for type 2 diabetes.Fruit juices, in particular, are high in fructose, which is a simple sugar similar to glucose. Over time, excessive consumption of sugary beverages can put a strain on the pancreas, leading to decreased insulin production. When the body doesn't have enough insulin to convert blood glucose into energy or store it as glycogen, there can be a build-up of glucose in the bloodstream. This elevated blood glucose level is a key indicator of untreated or uncontrolled diabetes.In summary, while fruit juices and fizzy drinks may not directly cause diabetes, their high sugar content and potential contribution to obesity can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, especially when consumed in excessive amounts over a prolonged period. It is essential to maintain a balanced diet and moderate the intake of sugary beverages to support overall health and reduce the risk of diabetes and its complications.

The pancreas is the factory that produces insulin. Insulin is the key to control blood glucose. Glucose is fuel for the body.
